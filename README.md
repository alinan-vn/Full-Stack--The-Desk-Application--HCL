# Fix Bugs of the Application Assessment for HCL

## Project Objective
- As a developer, fix the bugs in the application using the appropriate algorithmic techniques.

## Background of the problem statement
- You have been assigned a few tasks during the sprint planning. Solving the bugs raised by the testing team is one among them. You are given the boilerplate code and are asked to complete it by fixing the bugs.

## Bugs to be fixed:

- Add the missing source code to the application based on searching technique. Find the appropriate comments to code for the searching technique.
- Write source code for sorting the predefined array and ensure the functionality of the application. Find the appropriate comments to code for sorting the predefined array.
- You can download the boilerplate code by executing the command below in your git bash. git clone https://github.com/Simplilearn-Edu/Full-Stack---The-Desk-Application-.git

## Requirements
- Eclipse/IntelliJ: An IDE to code for the application.
- Java: A programming language to develop the prototype
- Git: To connect and push files from the local system to GitHub.
- GitHub: To store the application code and track its versions. 
- Search and Sort techniques: Select the relevant data structure algorithms to fix the bugs
- The source code should be pushed to your GitHub repositories. You need to document the steps and write the algorithms in the Google Docs.
- The link of your GitHub repository is must. In order to track your task, you need to share the link of the repository. You can add a section in the Google Docs.
- Document the step-by-step process involved in completing this task.

## Description of Complete Project
- The currernt code addresses and fixes all of the bugs described in the 'Bugs to be fixed' section.
- Furthermore, the code has been refactored.
- Bugs fixed: 
    - Sorts the array in an increasing order using a Collections.sort() method
    - Finds a value inputted and returns whether the value is in the array or not
    - Array is changed and reflects that change when deleted, sorted, or added to. Previously, it would always reset after being deleted.
